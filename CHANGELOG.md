## v4.4.0

This minor release mainly includes documentation changes, but also a small breaking change in [[a389629](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/commit/a389629387b74805ffe2f4d6515ac05b8f62b4d5)].
Work chains that wrap the `PwBaseWorkChain` for an `nscf` or `bands` calculation and add the `parent_folder` during runtime would have to adapt the `validator` for the `pw` name space as follows to avoid warnings:

```python
    spec.inputs['nscf']['pw'].validator = PwCalculation.validate_inputs_base
```

Now, the validator that checks for the presence of the `parent_folder` in the inputs is adapted so it checks if the  `parent_folder` port is in the name space.
If not, the validation is skipped.
So work chains that wrap the `PwBaseWorkChain` to run an `nscf` or `bands` calculation can simply exclude the `parent_folder` port in the `pw` name space:

```python
    spec.expose_inputs(
        PwBaseWorkChain,
        namespace='nscf',
        exclude=('clean_workdir', 'pw.structure', 'pw.parent_folder'),
        namespace_options={
            'help': 'Inputs for the `PwBaseWorkChain` of the `nscf` calculation.',
            'validator': validate_nscf
        }
    )
```

A new calculation function `create_magnetic_configuration` is added, which can be used to create a new `StructureData` with the required kinds for a specific magnetic configuration.
For example, for an HCP structure with two Co sites:

```python
In [1]: from aiida import orm

In [2]: from ase.build import bulk
   ...: structure = orm.StructureData(ase=bulk('Co', 'hcp', 2.5, 4.06))
```

The `create_magnetic_configuration` can be used to quickly create a new `StructureData` with two different kinds:

```python
In [3]: from aiida_quantumespresso.calculations.functions.create_magnetic_configuration import create_magnetic_configuration
   ...:
   ...: results = create_magnetic_configuration(structure, [-2, 2])

In [4]: results['structure'].sites
Out[4]:
[<Site: kind name 'Co0' @ -2.7755575615629e-17,1.4433756729741,2.03>,
 <Site: kind name 'Co1' @ 0.0,0.0,0.0>]

In [5]: results['magnetic_moments'].get_dict()
Out[5]: {'Co0': 2, 'Co1': -2}
```

For more information, see the tutorial on how to work with magnetic systems:

https://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/magnetism.html

The release also makes an important change in the dependencies related to a bug introduced in `pydantic`, see:

https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/5821

Hence the version of `pydantic` is adapted to `1.10.8`, where this bug is fixed.

## v4.3.0

Release version `4.3.0` comes with a lot of new features, improvements and bug fixes.
Although this is technically a minor release, this new version does come with some _minor_ breaking changes:

* The default value of `clean_workdir` was changed from `True` to `False`.
* The `automatic_parallelization` feature of the `PwBaseWorkChain` was removed, as this was badly broken with no clear path to fixing it. Moreover, [v7.1 of Quantum ESPRESSO](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/releases/qe-7.1) has implemented some basic automated parallelization for `pw.x` when no parallelization flags are specified.
* Work chains no longer set/override static inputs inside the steps of their outline. All defaults are moved to the protocol files instead, and it is recommended to always use the `get_builder_from_protocol()` method to run a work chain. For more details, [see the corresponding PR](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/902).

Support for Quantum ESPRESSO v7.2 `pw.x` parsing was added, as well as the `HubbardStructureData` data plugin and corresponding implementation in the `PwCalculation` plugin to support the [new input syntax for using Hubbard corrections](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/releases/qe-7.1#incompatible-changes-in-71-version) in the `pw.x` code.

For `ph.x`, the symmetry labels printed in the `stdout` after the mode frequencies are now parsed for each q-point.
In the case of restarts in the `PhBaseWorkChain`, care has been taken to properly parse these symmetry labels from the separate output files and merge them, so the `output_parameters` are the same with or without restarts.

The `XpsWorkChain` has been added to compute the XPS spectra using core-hole pseudo potentials and the `pw.x` code. The work chain can handle both molecules and crystals. The chemical shifts, as well as the cole-level binding energy can be obtained.

Finally, improved error handling for the `PwBaseWorkChain` was implemented for several typical failure modes of the `pw.x` code, and the `CRASH` file is now also retrieved, as this will be the default location of error messages from Quantum ESPRESSO v7.2 onwards.

## v3.4.2

This patch release fixes several bugs in the protocols feature, adds support for the `CutoffsPseudoPotentialFamily` introduced in `aiida-pseudo==0.6.1` and adapts the `ProtocolMixin` class so it can also be used by other packages.
The legacy `PwBandStructureWorkChain` is now also fully deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
It has been replaced by the `PwBandsWorkChain`, which is now equipped with its own protocol through the `get_builder_from_protocol()` method.

## v3.0.0:
This is the first version to support `aiida-core~=1.0` and since the API of `aiida-core` changed significantly, the code of `aiida-quantumespresso` did as well.
This means that `aiida-quantumespresso` `v2.0` and `v3.0` are fundamentally incompatible, which is why we do not include an explicit change log list.


## v2.1.0:
Minor release adding a new feature, fixing a critical bug in `PwParser` and reducing the size of the package

*Nota Bene*: due to a critical bug discoverd in the `PwParser` (see below) the parser version has been updated to `v2.1.0`.
Calculations parsed with an older version potentially contain incorrect reduced symmetries in the `output_parameters` node.
Instructions to check the version of the parser that was used, [can be found in the documentation](http://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/calculation_plugins/pw.html#parser-version)

### Improvements
- Added support for the `ATOMIC_FORCES` card in the `PwCalculation` plugin [[#168]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/168)
- Tests and fixture data have been removed from the main package, massively reducing distribution size [[#154]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/154)

### Critical bug fixes
- The mapping of the raw symmetry operations onto a reduced set in the `PwParser` contained a bug and mapped incorrect rotations [[#171]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/171)

### Minor bug fixes
- Fix a bug in `ProjwfcParser` where due to improper sorting, projections were associated with the wrong output files [[#165]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/165)
- Adapt the keyword `type` to `node_type` in the `Node.get_outputs` method [[#143]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/143)
- Fix a missing parameter in the string formatter of one of the error handlers of `PwBaseWorkChain` [[#158]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/158)


## v2.0.1:
Patch release with some small bug fixes

### Update to newer versions of Quantum ESPRESSO
- Add the input helper XML files for v6.0, v6.1 and v6.2 [[#135]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/135)

### Bug fixes
