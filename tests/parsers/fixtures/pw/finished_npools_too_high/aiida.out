     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
     Message from routine divide_et_impera:
     suboptimal parallelization: some nodes have no k-points

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     scalapack distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  2*  2 procs)
