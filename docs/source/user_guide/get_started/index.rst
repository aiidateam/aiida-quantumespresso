Get started
===========

We show below a number of tutorials for the main Quantum ESPRESSO codes
(PW, PH, CP, and one of the post-processing tools PROJWFC) that will
guide you through submitting your Quantum ESPRESSO calculations using AiiDA.

Note: these tutorials assume you already installed AiiDA and properly
configured AiiDA and configured one Quantum ESPRESSO code.
You can check the `main AiiDA-core documentation <http://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for more information on how to perform these steps.
