class BaseRestartWorkChain(WorkChain):
    """Base restart work chain

    This work chain serves as the starting point for more complex work chains that will be designed to run a calculation
    that might need multiple restarts to come to a successful end. These restarts may be necessary because a single
    calculation run is not sufficient to achieve a fully converged result, or certain errors maybe encountered which
    are recoverable.

    This work chain implements the most basic functionality to achieve this goal. It will launch calculations,
    restarting until it is completed successfully or the maximum number of iterations is reached. It can recover from
    errors through error handlers that can be attached dynamically through the `register_error_handler` decorator.

    The idea is to sub class this work chain and leverage the generic error handling that is implemented in the few
    outline methods. The minimally required outline would look something like the following::

        cls.setup
        while_(cls.should_run_calculation)(
            cls.run_calculation,
            cls.inspect_calculation,
        )

    Each of these methods can of course be overriden but they should be general enough to fit most calculation cycles.
    The `run_calculation` method will take the inputs for the calculation process from the context under the key
    `inputs`. The user should therefore make sure that before the `run_calculation` method is called, that the to be
    used inputs are stored under `self.ctx.inputs`. One can update the inputs based on the results from a prior
    calculation by calling an outline method just before the `run_calculation` step, for example::

        cls.setup
        while_(cls.should_run_calculation)(
            cls.prepare_calculation,
            cls.run_calculation,
            cls.inspect_calculation,
        )

    Where in the `prepare_calculation` method, the inputs dictionary at `self.ctx.inputs` is updated before the next
    calculation will be run with those inputs.

    The `_calculation_class` attribute should be set to the `CalcJob` class that should be run in the loop.
