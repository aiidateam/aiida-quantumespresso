     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       8 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 8
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       8
     248208 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 
 
  Reading nscf_save data

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./out/aiida.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
