## v3.0.0:
This is the first version to support `aiida-core~=1.0` and since the API of `aiida-core` changed significantly, the code of `aiida-quantumespresso` did as well.
This means that `aiida-quantumespresso` `v2.0` and `v3.0` are fundamentally incompatible, which is why we do not include an explicit change log list.


## v2.1.0:
Minor release adding a new feature, fixing a critical bug in `PwParser` and reducing the size of the package

*Nota Bene*: due to a critical bug discoverd in the `PwParser` (see below) the parser version has been updated to `v2.1.0`.
Calculations parsed with an older version potentially contain incorrect reduced symmetries in the `output_parameters` node.
Instructions to check the version of the parser that was used, [can be found in the documentation](http://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/calculation_plugins/pw.html#parser-version)

### Improvements
- Added support for the `ATOMIC_FORCES` card in the `PwCalculation` plugin [[#168]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/168)
- Tests and fixture data have been removed from the main package, massively reducing distribution size [[#154]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/154)

### Critical bug fixes
- The mapping of the raw symmetry operations onto a reduced set in the `PwParser` contained a bug and mapped incorrect rotations [[#171]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/171)

### Minor bug fixes
- Fix a bug in `ProjwfcParser` where due to improper sorting, projections were associated with the wrong output files [[#165]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/165)
- Adapt the keyword `type` to `node_type` in the `Node.get_outputs` method [[#143]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/143)
- Fix a missing parameter in the string formatter of one of the error handlers of `PwBaseWorkChain` [[#158]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/158)


## v2.0.1:
Patch release with some small bug fixes

### Update to newer versions of Quantum ESPRESSO
- Add the input helper XML files for v6.0, v6.1 and v6.2 [[#135]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/135)

### Bug fixes
- Parse the standard output in the `PwParser` even if XML file is missing in order to still get errors in output parameters [[#133]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/133)
- Bugfix for the `_error_handlers` list attribute from `BaseRestartWorkChain` that is now appended to the correct list[[#127]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/127)
- Number of minor bugfixes to the `PwParser` to adapt to the updated AiiDA API [[#123]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/123) [[#138]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/138)
- Fix a bug causing cmdline args to be ignored in `namelists.py` [[#122]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso/pull/122)


## v2.0.0:

- Add the `Q2rBaseWorkChain` and `MatdynBaseWorkChain` [[#93]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/pull/93)
- Use the update wrappers for `SeeKpath` in `aiida-core` in the `PwBandsWorkChain` [[#104]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/pull/104)
- Removed the use of `deepcopy` in all workchains, which can lead to bugs or unwanted duplication of nodes [[#118]](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida_core/pull/118)
