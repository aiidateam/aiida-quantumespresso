Phonon
======

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

In this chapter will get you through the launching of a phonon calculation with Quantum ESPRESSO, with ``ph.x``, a density functional perturbation theory code.
For this tutorial, it is required that you managed to run the ``pw.x`` calculation, which is at the base of the phonon code; and of course it is assumed that you already know how to use the QE code.

The input of a phonon calculation can be very simple, but requires the output of a previous ``pw.x`` calculation.
Here we will try to compute the dynamical matrix on a mesh of points (actually consisting of a 1x1x1 mesh - i.e. only the gamma point - for brevity).
The input file that we want to create is this one::

    &INPUTPH
        fildyn = 'DYN_MAT/dynamical-matrix-'
        ldisp = .true.
        nq1 = 1
        nq2 = 1
        nq3 = 1
        outdir = './out/'
        prefix = 'aiida'
        tr2_ph =   1.0000000000d-08
        verbosity = 'high'
    /

Walkthrough
-----------

Setting up the input for a ``PhCalculation`` is simpler than doing so for the ``PwCalculation``.
The only novel thing you will have to learn is how to link the ``pw.x`` calculation as a a parent, so AiiDA can restart properly from the output files of this run.
As before, we'll write the script step by step.

We first load a couple of useful modules, and load the AiiDA profile::

    from aiida import orm, load_profile
    load_profile()

We'll also assume you've managed to run a previous ``pw.x`` calculation with AiiDA, and know the PK of the corresponding calculation job.

You need to have compiled the code, either locally or on a remote machine, and have configured a new ``ph.x`` code for AiiDA in the same way as you set up the one for ``pw.x``.
Then we load the ``Code`` class-instance from the database::

    code_label = 'qe-7.0-ph@localhost'
    code = orm.load_code(code_label)

Here, the full label of the code we want to run is ``qe-7.0-ph@localhost``, indicating it is a code set up on the local ``localhost`` computer.
From the code instance, we can obtain a builder for the calculation using the ``get_builder()`` method::

    builder = code.get_builder()

Next, we'll populate this builder with the required inputs.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

Just like the for the ``pw.x`` calculation, we have to provide the input parameters as an instance of a ``Dict`` node.
Again, ``Dict`` will simply represent a nested dictionary in the database, namelists at the first level, and then variables and values.
But this time of course, we need to use the variables of ``ph.x``.
For this example, the parameters will be exceedingly simple::

    parameters = orm.Dict(
        dict={
            'INPUTPH': {
                'tr2_ph' : 1.0e-8,
            }
        }
    )
    builder.parameters = parameters

You may be wondering why inputs like ``fildyn`` and ``prefix`` are not specified.
These are set automatically by the ``PhCalculation`` plugin, and are blocked to only allow certain defaults and avoid issues with linking the ``ph.x`` calculation to e.g. future ``q2r.x`` calculations.
Similarly, the ``ldisp`` and ``nq1`` inputs are not specified through the ``parameters`` input, but rather by the ``qpoints`` one, as we'll show in the next section.

Q-points
^^^^^^^^

Next we'll specify the q-point mesh we want to use for the ``ph.x`` calculation.
As mentioned above, for this example we'll be running a single q-point (i.e. a 1x1x1 mesh)::

    q_points = orm.KpointsData()
    q_points.set_kpoints_mesh([1, 1, 1])

    builder.qpoints = q_points

The plugin will automatically convert this ``KpointsData`` input to the necessary tags in the input file, similar to what is done for the ``PwCalculation``.

.. note::

    Instead of defining a q-points mesh, you can also define the q-points as a list, see the :ref:`topics:data_types:materials:kpoints` documentation.

Parent calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The phonon calculation needs to start from an already completed ``pw.x`` to do the DFPT calculation.
In order to do this, you will set the directory where you ran the ``pw.x`` calculation as a ``parent_folder`` of the ``ph.x`` calculation.

You first need to remember the PK of the parent calculation that you launched previously (let's say it's ``8394``).
Let's load this calculation job node and get the ``remote_folder`` where the calculation ran from its outputs::

    parent_calculation = orm.load_node(8394)
    parent_folder = parent_calculation.outputs.remote_folder

Next, we'll add this ``RemoteData`` node as an input to the ``builder``::

    builder.parent_folder = parent_folder

Now, the ``PhCalculation`` plugin will copy the required output of the ``pw.x`` calculation before starting the ``ph.x`` run.

Scheduler settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we'll set the walltime of our calculation, as well as the resources we want to use::

    builder.metadata.options.max_wallclock_seconds = 30 * 60 # 30 min
    builder.metadata.options.resources = {'num_machines': 1}

These can depend on whether the code has been set up locally or remotely, and the scheduler used, see :ref:`aiida:topics:schedulers`.

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

Now, everything is ready, and just like the ``PwCalculation``, you only need to instruct AiiDA to submit the calculation to the daemon::

    from aiida.engine import submit
    submit(builder)

Complete script
---------------

The tutorial above describes how to set up the basic inputs for a ``ph.x`` calculation step by step.
Below you can find a complete script for you to adapt and run directly.
Make sure not to forget to change the ``parent_pk`` and ``code_label``!

::

    from aiida import orm, load_profile
    load_profile()

    #####################
    # ADAPT TO YOUR NEEDS
    parent_pk = 8394
    code_label = 'qe-7.0-ph@localhost'
    #####################

    code = orm.load_code(code_label)

    parameters = orm.Dict(
        dict={
            'INPUTPH': {
                'tr2_ph' : 1.0e-8,
            }
        }
    )

    q_points = orm.KpointsData()
    q_points.set_kpoints_mesh([1, 1, 1])

    parent_calculation = orm.load_node(parent_pk)
    parent_folder = parent_calculation.outputs.remote_folder

    builder = code.get_builder()

    builder.parameters = parameters
    builder.qpoints = q_points
    builder.parent_folder = parent_folder
    builder.metadata.options.max_wallclock_seconds = 30 * 60 # 30 min
    builder.metadata.options.resources = {'num_machines': 1}

    from aiida.engine import submit
    submit(builder)
