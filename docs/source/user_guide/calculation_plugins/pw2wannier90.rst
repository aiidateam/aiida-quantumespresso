Pw2Wannier90
++++++++++++

Description
-----------
Use the plugin to support inputs of Quantum Espresso pw2wannier90.x executable. Computes the
:math:`M_{mn}`, :math:`A_{mn}` and similar matrices needed in input by the Wannier90 code.

See the `Wannier90 documentation`_ to know which quantities are computed and their meaning

.. _Wannier90 documentation: http://www.wannier.org/user_guide.html

Supported codes
---------------
* tested from pw2wannier90.x v.5.1.2 onwards

Inputs
------
* **parent_calculation**, A PW calculation. It is also recommended that a bands calculation be used as the parent
  for the best viewing results, though this is not mandatory.

* **parameters**, class :py:class:`Dict <aiida.orm.nodes.data.dict.Dict>`
  Input parameters of projwfc.x, as a nested dictionary, mapping the input of QE.
  See the QE documentation for the full list of variables and their meaning.

* **nnkp_file**, class :py:class:`SinglefileData <aiida.orm.nodes.data.singlefile.SinglefileData>`
  A SinglefileData containing the `.nnkp` file, typically generated by Wannier90 during the preprocess phase
  (e.g., using the `-pp` flag to the `wannier90.x` executable.

* **settings**, class :py:class:`Dict <aiida.orm.nodes.data.dict.Dict>` (optional)
  An optional dictionary that activates non-default operations. See discussion below for possible options.

Outputs
-------
As no parser is implemented yet, no specific outputs except for the standard AiiDA ones (like the RemoteData output)
are created. If you want to retrieve some files (like the `.mmn` or `.amn` files)
you can decide add a key-value pair to the optional `settings` input
:py:class:`Dict <aiida.orm.nodes.data.dict.Dict>` node, with key `ADDITIONAL_RETRIEVE_LIST` and where
the value is a list of filenames to retrieve. They will, as usual, be saved in an output
:py:class:`FolderData <aiida.orm.nodes.data.folder.FolderData>` node.

Errors
------
Errors of the parsing are reported in the log of the calculation (accessible
with the ``verdi calculation logshow`` command).
No parsing is performed at the moment.
