## Running a `pw.x` calculation through the CLI

The simplest way to run a first `pw.x` calculation with `aiida-quantumespresso` is through the [command line interface (CLI)](#reference-cli) that ships with the package.

:::{margin} ❗️Important
This is a margin note.
:::

```console
aiida-quantumespresso calculation launch pw -X pw@locahost -F SSSP/1.1/PBE/efficiency
```

If everything is setup correctly, you should output that looks something like the following:

```console
Running a PwCalculation...
PwCalculation<59517> terminated with state: finished [0]

Output link               Node pk and type
------------------------------------------------------------
output_band               BandsData<59520>
output_parameters         Dict<59522>
output_trajectory         TrajectoryData<59521>
remote_folder             RemoteData<59518>
retrieved                 FolderData<59519>
```

The command ran a {{ PwCalculation }}, with the identifier `59517` and it finished correctly.

:::{note}
We can know that the job finished correctly because it says its state is `finished [0]`.
The `0` is the exit status of the job, which means it was successful.
A non-zero exit code means the primary objective of the calculation was not (fully) achieved or an error occurred.
:::

The outputs that were generated by the calculation are printed to screen.
To obtain more information about the calculation that ran, such as its inputs, run `verdi process show <IDENTIFIER>`

```console
verdi process show 59517

```

The calculation received a number of inputs: `pseudos`, `code`, `kpoints`, `parameters` and a `structure`.
The `code` was specified through the `-X` option when we invoked the CLI command to launch the calculation.
Other inputs, such as `structure`, `parameters` etc. were created automatically by the CLI command.

The inputs can be introspected through the `verdi` CLI that ships with `aiida-core`.
For example, the structure can be visualized using the command:

```console
verdi data core.structure show 56731
```

This should open a new dialog with a visualization of the silicon crystal structure that was automatically created for this calculation.
Similarly, the `parameters` can be shown using:

```console
verdi node attributes 59516

PK: 59516
{
    "CONTROL": {
        "calculation": "scf"
    },
    "SYSTEM": {
        "ecutrho": 240.0,
        "ecutwfc": 30.0
    }
}
```

Likewise, the output parameters (`output_parameters`), which are of the same type (`Dict`) of the input parameters (`parameters`) can also be shown:

```console
verdi node attributes 59522

PK: 59522
{
    "beta_real_space": false,
    "convergence_info": {
        "scf_conv": {
            "convergence_achieved": true,
            "n_scf_steps": 6,

        }
    },

    "scf_iterations": 6,
    "volume": 40.02575122515,
    "wall_time_seconds": 1.23,
}
```

The output will show a number of parameters that have been automatically parsed from the output of the `pw.x` calculation.
Note that the output has been shortened for clarity and not all parsed output parameters are shown.

## Running a `pw.x` calculation through the API

The following minimal example shows how to run a `pw.x` calculation through AiiDA's Python API.
For the purposes of this demonstration, the electronic ground state of an fcc silicon crystal structure is computed.

:::{tip}
The code that is shown below in snippets can be {download}`downloaded as a script <include/scripts/run_pw_basic.py>`.
Save the script to a file, make it executable and then simply execute it to run the example calculation.
:::

First, import the required classes and functions:

```python
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, KpointsData, StructureData, load_code, load_group
```

Then, load the code that was setup in AiiDA for `pw.x` and get an instance of the [process builder](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/usage.html#process-builder):

```python
# Load the code configured for ``pw.x``. Make sure to replace this string
# with the label that you used in the setup of the code.
code = load_code('pw@localhost')
builder = code.get_builder()
```

The process builder can be used to assign the inputs that are to be used for the calculation.
When an input is assigned, it is automatically validated.
Let's first define a structure and assign it to the builder:

```python
# Create a silicon fcc crystal
from ase.build import bulk
structure = StructureData(ase=bulk('Si', 'fcc', 5.43))
builder.structure = structure
```

To construct a crystal structure, we use the `bulk` method of the [ASE library](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/build/build.html#ase.build.bulk).
This is then wrapped in a `StructureData` node such that it can be stored in AiiDA's provenance graph, and assigned to the builder.

Next, we need to define the pseudopotentials.
If the pseudopotentials were installed using the `aiida-pseudo` package, as described in the [installation guide](installation-setup-pseudopotentials), that can be done as follows:

```python
# Load the pseudopotential family.
pseudo_family = load_group('SSSP/1.1/PBE/efficiency')
builder.pseudos = pseudo_family.get_pseudos(structure=structure)
```

The parameters of the input file that will be read by `pw.x` are defined through the `parameters` input.
A minimal setup to run an SCF calculation is shown below:

```python
# Request the recommended wavefunction and charge density cutoffs
# for the given structure and energy units.
cutoff_wfc, cutoff_rho = pseudo_family.get_recommended_cutoffs(
    structure=structure,
    unit='Ry'
)

parameters = Dict({
    'CONTROL': {
        'calculation': 'scf'
    },
    'SYSTEM': {
        'ecutwfc': cutoff_wfc,
        'ecutrho': cutoff_rho,
    }
})
builder.parameters = parameters
```

:::{note}
The `pw.x` code actually requires more input parameters than have been specified in the example above.
The other required parameters are actually automatically defined by the {{ PwCalculation }} plugin, based on for example the input structure.
To find out what other parameters can be specified, please refer to the [documentation of Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PW.html).
Note that certain parameters cannot be manually specified as these are reserved for the plugin to be set.
:::

The k-points to be used for the calculation are defined using the `KpointsData` class:

```python
# Generate a 2x2x2 Monkhorst-Pack mesh
kpoints = KpointsData()
kpoints.set_kpoints_mesh([2, 2, 2])
builder.kpoints = kpoints
```

Finally, specify the amount of CPUs that the calculation should use and how long it can run before it should be killed:

```python
# Run the calculation on 1 CPU and kill it if it runs longer than 1800 seconds.
# Set ``withmpi`` to ``False`` if ``pw.x`` was compiled without MPI support.
builder.metadata.options = {
    'resources': {
        'num_machines': 1,
    },
    'max_wallclock_seconds': 1800,
    'withmpi': False,
}
```

All required inputs have now been defined.
The calculation can be started by launching the process builder:

```python
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```

When the calculation is finished, `run.get_node` will return a tuple of two values: `results` and `node`.
The `results` will be a dictionary of all the output nodes that were produced and the `node` will hold a reference to the node that represents the calculation in AiiDA's provenance graph.
When the calculation is finished, check whether it was successful through its exit status:

```python
node.exit_status
```

If the calculation finished successfully, this will return `0`.
A non-zero exit code means the primary objective of the calculation was not (fully) achieved or an error occurred.

The `results` variable contains a dictionary of the created output nodes.
Print it to see exactly which outputs were created and what their identifiers are:

```python
print(results)
{
    'output_band': <BandsData: uuid: a82526b7-fb7f-4638-a1e1-f72ad04a5f13 (pk: 59537)>,
    'output_trajectory': <TrajectoryData: uuid: 4122ba08-6318-4029-9892-55b29e89a39c (pk: 59538)>,
    'output_parameters': <Dict: uuid: 82fe2b57-0dc0-4031-81a0-e80ed34db680 (pk: 59539)>,
    'remote_folder': <RemoteData: uuid: 672113fd-7177-4688-ad77-674703b8f611 (pk: 59535)>,
    'retrieved': <FolderData: uuid: 5f44b880-4c74-4194-9484-0c51ec4f1a34 (pk: 59536)>
}
```

To show the parsed output parameters, call:

```python
results['output_parameters'].base.attributes.all
{
    'energy': -153.30519007432,
    'volume': 40.02575122515,
    ....
}
```

The complete output that was written by `pw.x` to stdout, can be retrieved as follows:

```python
results['retrieved'].base.repository.get_object_content('aiida.out')
```
